# Week 1 – Day 3: Variables and Program Flow

## Goal
Understand how variables store values in memory and how a C++ program executes step by step.

## What I Practiced
- Declaring and initializing variables  
- Assigning new values to existing variables  
- Tracking how values change during execution  
- Printing values to observe program flow  

## Key Concepts
- Variables are **named memory locations**  
- Assignment happens **sequentially, line by line**  
- A variable’s value can **change multiple times** during execution  
- Local variables inside `main()` exist only while the program runs  

## Practice Description
A small program was written to demonstrate how values are calculated, reassigned, and tracked as the program executes.  
The focus was on **mental tracing** rather than complexity.

## Commands Used
```bash
g++ program_flow.cpp -0 main
./main

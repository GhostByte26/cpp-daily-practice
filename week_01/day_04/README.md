# Week 1 – Day 4: Conditional Statements (if / else)

## Goal
Learn how to control program flow using conditional statements and make decisions based on logical conditions.

## What I Practiced
- Using `if`, `else if`, and `else`
- Comparing values with relational operators
- Evaluating boolean expressions
- Controlling which code executes based on conditions
- Writing clear decision-based output

## Concepts Learned
- Conditions evaluate to either `true` or `false`
- Only one branch of an `if / else if / else` chain executes
- Order of conditions matters
- Logical operators like `&&` combine conditions
- `==` compares values, while `=` assigns values

## Exercises Completed
- Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
- Determine whether a number is even or odd
- Implement a simple grading system
- Create an access control check using age and ID
- Compare two numbers and determine the larger value
- Commands Used: g++ conditional-practice.cpp, ./main
